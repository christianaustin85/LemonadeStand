# Lemonade Stand Simulator
---

## About
This project is a text-based game where the player owns and operates a lemonade stand.  The basis of this project was an assignment completed as part of my Bachelor's Degree program at Park University.  It has been significantly expanded from its original state to incorporate additional game mechanics.

## Current State
As of right now, the current release of the program is stable, yet still very simple.  The player controls one lemonade stand and starts with a fixed amount of supplies (lemons, sugar, and water).  The player is prompted to make choices of making lemonade, selling lemonade, viewing information about their lemonade stand, and ending the game.

## Future Improvements
[ ] Incorporate a store class to buy/sell supplies
[ ] Incorporate a system for time progression
[ ] Create random events to happen every hour
[ ] Create NPCs that the player will interact with
[ ] Provide for game saving and score tracking
